## ðŸ“˜ Project Description: Simple PDF Management Web System

This web system is designed to manage and display PDF documents. It includes a basic admin panel for uploading PDF files and a public-facing page for viewing and downloading them. The system should be lightweight and use only HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHPâ€”compatible with typical shared hosting environments. No frameworks or databases are required.

### ðŸŽ¯ Features

#### 1. **Admin Upload Page (`admin.php`)**

- A password-protected form (basic PHP password check is enough) where the admin can:
  - Upload a PDF file.
  - The uploaded PDF must be named using the **date format** `YYYY-MM-DD.pdf` (e.g., `2025-04-18.pdf`).
  - Automatically save PDFs in a `pdfs/` folder on the server.
  - Overwrite or reject duplicates based on filename.
  - Display upload success/failure messages.

#### 2. **Public Viewer Page (`index.php`)**

- Embed the **most recent PDF** (determined by filename, sorted in descending date order) at the top of the page using an `<iframe>` or `<embed>`.
- List **all available PDFs** below the embedded viewer with:
  - File names (which are also the dates)
  - Download links
- The page should be visually clean and mobile-friendly.

### ðŸ›  Technologies Required

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JS
- **Backend:** PHP
- **Hosting:** Must be deployable on shared hosting (e.g., cPanel or similar)
- **Security:** Basic password check for admin page (hardcoded is fine)

---

### âœ… Constraints

- No frameworks (like Laravel, React, etc.)
- No database (file-based system only)
- File names must follow the format `YYYY-MM-DD.pdf` and act as both the title and date
- System must be portable and easily deployable on cheap or free hosting
