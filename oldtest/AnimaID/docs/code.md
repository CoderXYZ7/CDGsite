# AnimaID Account System Implementation

I'll create a comprehensive implementation of the AnimaID account system you've designed. Here's how I'll structure this:

## Database Implementation (MySQL)

```sql

```

## PHP API Implementation

### Configuration File (config.php)

```php

```

### Database Connection (Database.php)

```php

```

### Authentication Class (Auth.php)

```php

```

### API Endpoints (index.php)

```php

```

### Admin Functions (Admin.php)

```php

```

### Tag Management (TagManager.php)

```php

```

## Implementation Notes

1. **Security**:
   - Uses prepared statements to prevent SQL injection
   - Passwords are hashed with bcrypt
   - JWT tokens for authentication
   - Permission checks for admin functions

2. **Database**:
   - Proper foreign key relationships
   - Indexes on frequently queried columns
   - Data validation at application and database levels

3. **API**:
   - RESTful design
   - JSON responses
   - Proper HTTP status codes
   - CORS support

4. **Extensibility**:
   - Modular design for easy expansion
   - Permission system allows for flexible access control
   - Tag system enables user categorization

## Deployment Instructions

1. Set up a MySQL database and run the provided SQL script
2. Configure the `config.php` file with your database credentials and JWT secret
3. Install required PHP dependencies (PDO, JWT library)
4. Deploy the PHP files to your web server
5. Set up proper HTTPS configuration
6. Configure rate limiting at the web server level if needed

This implementation provides a solid foundation for the AnimaID account system with all the core functionality you specified. The system can be extended with additional features as needed while maintaining security and performance.
